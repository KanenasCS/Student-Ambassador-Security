# 🎓 Microsoft Student Ambassador Security Repo
## 🔐 About This Repo

This repository is part of my contributions as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, focused on Security, SIEM, and XDR.
It contains ready-to-use resources for the community:

✅ Microsoft Sentinel KQL queries (threat hunting, detections, dashboards)

✅ Sentinel playbooks (Logic Apps for automated response)

✅ Defender XDR lab scenarios and scripts

✅ Identity security (Entra ID Conditional Access, governance)

The goal is to help students, IT professionals, and Ambassadors learn and apply Microsoft Security technologies in real-world scenarios.
